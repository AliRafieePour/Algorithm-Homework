# My Algorithm Assignments
These are my assignments for the course Design and Analysis of Algorithms, mostly their gathered from Uva resourcers with the same title so one can easily find
the questions. The area which these assignments where mostly focused on was Devide and Conquer algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Network and Graph algorithms, and Greedy Algorithms
I implemented the assignments mainly with python but in case there were some time limits in our department's code judge, I had to consider languages like C++.
